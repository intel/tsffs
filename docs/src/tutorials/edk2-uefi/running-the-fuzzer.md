# Running the Fuzzer

Now that we have configured the fuzzer and harnessed our target application, it's time
to run again:

```sh
./simics --no-win run.simics
```

Press Ctrl+C at any time to stop the fuzzing process and return to the SIMICS CLI.
From there you can run `continue` to continue the fuzzing process.
