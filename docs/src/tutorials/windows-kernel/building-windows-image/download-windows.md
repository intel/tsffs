# Download Windows

Download an ISO for 64-bit Windows 11 from the [Direct
Link](https://software-static.download.prss.microsoft.com/dbazure/888969d5-f34g-4e03-ac9d-1f9786c66749/22631.2428.231001-0608.23H2_NI_RELEASE_SVC_REFRESH_CLIENTENTERPRISEEVAL_OEMRET_x64FRE_en-us.iso)
or if this does not work, download from the [Microsoft Evaluation
Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-11-enterprise). You
will be asked for your email and name, but there is no validation of this information
and you will be given a download link regardless of what is entered.

The ISO should have a filename like:

`22631.2428.231001-0608.23H2_NI_RELEASE_SVC_REFRESH_CLIENTENTERPRISEEVAL_OEMRET_x64FRE_en-us.iso`

This tutorial assumes version 23H2, but should be the same for future versions.
