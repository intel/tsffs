        #       needed to link can be found by searching the windows-rs repository on
        #       GitHub for the function name and looking at the filename that defines
        #       the wrapper, e.g.:
        #       https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/blob/1a2a9920df38678d1be4c6a6a6d43489a30ef4e9/crates/targets/baseline/ntdll.dll.c#L333
