//! Implements the state machine for this module. This state machine represents the different
//! states the module (and through it, simics) can be in and the transitions between those states
//!
//! The module starts in the `Uninitialized` state. This state is named slightly deceptively --
//! the module will do any allocations it needs, set up its components, map memory, and more
//! in this state.
//!
//! When the module is instructed to `Initialize`, it moves to a `HalfInitialized` state. In this
//! state, it has received the `InputConfig` from the client, but it has not applied it. Only
//! once the module sends back an `Initialized` message to the client is the module fully
//! `Initialized`, which means it has taken its initial snapshot and is ready to begin the fuzzing
//! process (in this state, the client has received any necessary shared information from the
//! module as well).
//!
//! Next, the module will receive a `Reset` signal and will enter the `HalfReady` state. The
//! module will internally reset the target state to the snapshot (on first run, this is
//! essentially a no-op) and send back a `Ready` message. Only then is the module ready to actually
//! run a test.
//!
//! Finally, the module will receive a `Run` signal, and will start running with the given input.
//! When the module reaches a `Stopped` state, it will signal back that it has stopped as well
//! as the reason. From this state, it can be `Reset` again before another `Run`.
//!
//! At any point, an `Exit` signal can be sent to cause the module to immediately exit cleanly.
