//! TFFS Module for SIMICS
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! This crate provides a client and module loadable by SIMICS to enable fuzzing on the SIMICS
//! platform. The client is intended to be used by the `simics-fuzz` crate, but it can be used
//! manually to enable additional use cases.
//!
//! # Capabilities
//!
//! The Module can:
//!
//! - Trace branch hits during an execution of a target on an x86_64 processor. These branches
//!   are traced into shared memory in the format understood by the AFL family of tools.
//! - Catch exception/fault events registered in an initial configuration or dynamically using
//!   a SIMICS Python script
//! - Catch timeout events registered in an initial configuration or dynamically using a SIMICS
//!   Python script
//! - Manage the state of a target under test by taking and restoring a snapshot of its state for
//!   deterministic snapshot fuzzing

#![deny(clippy::all)]
// NOTE: We have to do this a lot, and it sucks to have all these functions be unsafe
#![allow(clippy::not_unsafe_ptr_arg_deref)]
