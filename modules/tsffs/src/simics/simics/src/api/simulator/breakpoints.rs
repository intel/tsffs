#[simics_exception]
/// Add breakpoint on an object implementing the breakpoint interface. This is typically
/// a memory space object such as physical memory.
///
/// The default action for a triggered breakpoint is to return to the frontend (this can
/// be changed by using haps). On execution breakpoints Simics will return to the
/// frontend before the instructions is executed, while instructions triggering read or
/// write breakpoints will complete before control is returned to the frontend.
///
/// Several breakpoints can be set on the same address and Simics will break on them in
/// turn. If hap handlers are connected to the breakpoints they will also be executed in
/// turn. Hap handlers are called before the access is performed, allowing the user to
/// read a memory value that may be overwritten by the access. See the Simics Reference
/// Manual for a description of hap handlers.
///
/// Several attributes can be set for a breakpoint for breaking only when some
/// conditions are true. See the breakpoints attribute in the sim class.
///
/// This function returns the breakpoint id which is used for further reference to the
/// breakpoin
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// - `kind`: The kind argument sets what type of address to break on
/// - `access`: The access argument is a bit-field setting the type of access. Any
/// combination of the three alternatives can be given (added together).
/// - `address`: The address is the start of the breakpoint range
/// - `length` is its length in bytes. This range will be truncated as necessary to fit
/// in the address space. An access intersecting the given range will trigger the
/// breakpoint. If length is zero, the breakpoint range will be the entire address
/// space.
/// - `flags`: If the Sim_Breakpoint_Temporary bit is set, the breakpoint is
/// automatically disabled when triggered the first time. If the
/// Sim_Breakpoint_Simulation bit is set, the breakpoint will not show up in the
/// <bp-manager>.list command, nor can it be removed by the <bp-manager>.delete command.
/// Also, there will be no message printed on the Simics console when this breakpoint is
/// triggered. This bit should be set when using breakpoints to simulate the target
/// system; it will prevent Simics from temporarily disabling the breakpoint as an
/// optimization measure. This could otherwise happen during certain reverse execution
/// operations. If the Sim_Breakpoint_Private bit is set, the breakpoint will not show
/// up in the <bp-manager>.list command, nor can it be removed by the
/// <bp-manager>.delete command.
///
/// # Exceptions
///
/// - SimExc_General Thrown if the type or access arguments are illegal. Also thrown if
/// obj cannot handle breakpoints of the given kind.
