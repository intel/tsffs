# This is a list of released versions of packages. Given this list of
# all released versions of a package, we can compute what the next
# version is going to be.
#
# The columns are: package-number, version, build-id. For example, 
# "4711 3.2.1" 1501.
#
# Blank lines are ignored. Everything between a hash and end-of-line
# is ignored.
